                 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                      Version 3, 29 June 2007

   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
  the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
  License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

    0. Additional Definitions. 

    As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU
  General Public License.

    &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
  other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

    An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
  by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
  of using an interface provided by the Library.

    A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an
  Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
  with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked
  Version&quot;.

    The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the
  Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
  for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
  based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

    The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the
  object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
  and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
  Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

    1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

    You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
  without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

    2. Conveying Modified Versions.

    If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
  facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
  that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
  facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
  version:

     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
     ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
     function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
     whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
     this License applicable to that copy.

    3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

    The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
  a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
  code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
  material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
  layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
  (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
     covered by this License.

     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
     document.

    4. Combined Works.

    You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
  taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
  portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
  the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
     the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
     covered by this License.

     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
     document.

     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
     execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
     these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
     copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

     d) Do one of the following:

         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
         License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
         suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
         recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
         the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
         manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
         Corresponding Source.

         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
         Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
         a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
         system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
         of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
         Version. 

     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
     be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
     GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
     necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
     Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
     Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
     you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
     the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
     Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
     Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
     for conveying Corresponding Source.)

    5. Combined Libraries.

    You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side by side in a single library together with other library
  facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
  License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
  choice, if you do both of the following:

     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
     on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
     conveyed under the terms of this License.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
     is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
     accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

    6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;
  applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that published version or of any later version
  published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
  received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

    If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
  whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
  apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
  permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
  Library.</pre>
