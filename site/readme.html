<h1>Cuts - Cut-based AOP for Ruby</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Cuts is an expiremental pure-Ruby implimentation of cut-base AOP. Cuts are
a failry low-level system, so implementing them in pure-Ruby is no simple
accomplishment, even for a language as reflective and metaprogrammable as
Ruby.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Cuts started it’s life as a discussion about AOP on Ruby-talk, which led
to  a in-depth discussion between Trans and Peter Vanbroekhoven. The
outcome of those talks were three projects. &lt;a href=“<a
href="http://suby.rubyforge.org">Suby</a">suby.rubyforge.org”>Suby</a</a>&gt;
an early expiremental branch of Ruby; the RCRFoundry, a section of the Ruby
Garden Wiki dedicated to jointly developing RCRs; and the &lt;a
href=“rcr.html”&gt;Cut-based AOP RCR&lt;/a&gt;.  The RCR of course,
ultimately led to this project, as well as an expiremental Ruby 1.8.3 core
implementation (see the Suby homepage). We continue to touch up the &lt;a
href=“rcr.html”&gt;RCR&lt;/a&gt; but on the whole it is now
complete.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Please read &lt;a href=“rcr.html”&gt;Cut-based AOP for Ruby
RCR&lt;/a&gt;.</p>

<p>This Cuts library comes by way of &lt;a href=“<a
href="http://facets.rubyforge.org">Ruby”>facets.rubyforge.org“>Ruby</a>
Facets&lt;/a&gt;, where the implementation was orginally housed. Becuase of
it’s expiremental nature, it was deemd best to move it into it’s own
project as part of the ongoing work to make Facets a rock solid library.
Despite being expiremental, this  implementation does pass it’s unit
test. However, it has had litte trial in integrated tests. It will be
interesting to see if this library, as it matures, can prove robust enough
for production use. In either case, clearly it would be preferable to have
a Ruby-core implementation instead, but that potential is completely in
other persons hands.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Here is a quick and dirty example:</p>

<pre>require 'cuts'

class C
  def f ; &quot;f&quot; ; end
end

cut :G &lt; C do
  def f; '&lt;'+super+'&gt;' ; end
end

c = C.new

c.f  #=&gt; &quot;&amp;lt;f&amp;gt;&quot;</pre>

<p>For detailed usage documentation, please refer to the &lt;a
href=“docs/api/index.html”&gt;API Docs&lt;/a&gt;.</p>
