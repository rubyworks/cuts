<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Cuts is an expiremental pure-Ruby implimentation of cut-base AOP. Cuts are
a failry low-level system, so implementing them in pure-Ruby is no simple
accomplishment, even for a language as reflective and metaprogrammable as
Ruby.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Cuts started it’s life as a discussion about AOP on Ruby-talk, which led to
a in-depth discussion between Trans and Peter Vanbroekhoven. The outcome of
those talks were three projects. <a
href="http://suby.rubyforge.org">Suby</a> an early expiremental branch of
Ruby; the RCRFoundry, a section of the Ruby Garden Wiki dedicated to
jointly developing RCRs; and the <a href="http://rcr.html">Cut-based AOP
RCR</a>. The RCR of course, ultimately led to this project, as well as an
expiremental Ruby 1.8.3 core implementation (see the Suby homepage). We
continue to touch up the <a href="http://rcr.html">RCR</a> but on the whole
it is now complete.</p>

<p>Please read <a href="http://rcr.html">Cut-based AOP for Ruby RCR</a>.</p>

<p>This Cuts library comes by way of <a
href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets">Ruby Facets</a>, where the
implementation was orginally housed. Becuase of it’s expiremental nature,
it was deemd best to move it into it’s own project as part of the ongoing
work to make Facets a rock solid library. Despite being expiremental, this
implementation does pass it’s unit test. However, it has had litte trial in
integrated tests. It will be interesting to see if this library, as it
matures, can prove robust enough for production use. In either case,
clearly it would be preferable to have a Ruby-core implementation instead,
but that potential is completely in other persons hands.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Here is a quick and dirty example:</p>

<pre>require 'cuts'

class C
  def f ; &quot;f&quot; ; end
end

cut :G &lt; C do
  def f; '&lt;'+super+'&gt;' ; end
end

c = C.new

c.f  #=&gt; &quot;&amp;lt;f&amp;gt;&quot;</pre>
