This release completely overhauls how the the original
version of cuts was implemented.

Before, cuts where overriding the constant of the
original class and redirecting class changes
(define_method, alias_method, etc.) to the original
class. This works, and is technically more true to
the core idea of Cuts, but it is rather fragile --
getting a handle on the Cut vs. the Cut Class b/c
tricky.

The new implementation simply creates a module for
a cut instead, and then used #extend on objects 
upon instantiation. The end result is less dynamic
(cuts need to be defined up front), but it is more
stable. As long as #new, when overriden, is done so
properly (ie. use super or copy the cut extension
logic) everthing will work as expected.
